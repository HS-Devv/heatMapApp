# Heat Map Maker
A basic heat map making application, built for creating simple visualizations quickly. I made this application to learn java script and create some interesting visualizations.

# Useage:
In this early version of the heat map app, you are able to:
- Drag and draw a square anywhere on the canvas. 
- Move the squares position by clicking and dragging within its borders. 
- Adjust the square's size by clicking and dragging the handles.

The rectangles created by you will be white and added to an array called "rectangles".
The overlapping regions will be highlighted in red and added to an array called "overlapRects".

# To Do
Planned feautres for this app include:
- Gradient style heat maps.
- UI to adjust look, color, and various parameters on the heat map.
- Additional shape drawing tools (circle, polygons, pen tool)
- Import background images.
- Export to .jpg, .png, or .pdf format
